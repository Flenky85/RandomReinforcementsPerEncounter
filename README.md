# Random Reinforcements per Encounter

This mod adds random enemy reinforcements at the beginning of combat, scaling the encounter based on party strength to keep fights dynamic and unpredictable.

Important: This mod only works in turn-based mode, at least for now. I haven't found a reliable way to make it work in real-time combat.
